# Reading Progress Tracking
An application that uses text and eye-tracking data to predict read and unread words.

In general, the main problem of eye-tracking data analysis is high level of noise in data, comprised by measurement errors in determining gaze position on any kind of flat surface i.e., screen or sheet of paper. Currently, the most efforts to reduce measurement errors are usually applied on a registration step of the eye-tracking system, including signal filtering, smoothing and denoising, which does not utilize any high-level information about characteristics of gaze patterns. The target of this work is to combine the eye-tracking and text structure information to overcome this problem and get an application that will predict the "read" words with high accuracy.
